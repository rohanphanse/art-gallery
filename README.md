# Art Gallery

Decentralized art gallery built on NEAR blockchain.

Demo: https://rohanphanse.github.io/art-gallery/.

Learned how to deploy and interact with smart contracts on NEAR thanks to this amazing tutorial: https://dacade.org/communities/near/courses/near-101.

## Login Page
First, login into Decentralized Art Gallery with your NEAR wallet. To create a testnet wallet (no actual money), go to https://wallet.testnet.near.org/.
